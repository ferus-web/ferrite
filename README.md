# Ferrite
Ferrite is a set of routines and utilities that are shared across the entire Ferus projectbase. \
It implements things crucial to building web technologies in Nim.
It acts as an abstraction for different Ferus projects (Bali, Ferus, etc.) to reuse the same code.

Its code is mostly based off of other projects, like the [Ladybird browser](https://ladybird.org).
